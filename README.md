# Code-Quiz

## Description

This is a code quiz. This was created to test your knowledge on some basic code questions. It was created using javascript mainly and HTML. What I did was create a questions variable and put it in if and else statements. I also add eventlisteners to collect on the options you choose. I used apendChild and setAttributes to create tags through javascript. I added a timer that counts down and if it hits 0 your test is over as well as if you get a question wrong 10 seconds is deducted from your time. I wasn't able to figure out how to add the highscore page.
